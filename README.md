# Creating maps with R

In this repository I simply store some code and files to create beautiful and stunning maps in the R environment.
The code is based on (and largely copied from) the fantastic turorials by [Milos Popovic](https://www.youtube.com/@milos-makes-maps).
Anyone starting with maps in the R environment should visit his website.
